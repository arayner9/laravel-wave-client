# Introduction

Unlock the power of Laravel's [broadcasting system](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting)
with **Wave**. Imagine that real-time server broadcasting is possible over native HTTP without any WebSockets setup.

Meet the [**Server-sent Events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) üóº Works seamlessly with Laravel's default `redis` broadcasting driver and supports [Laravel Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo).

> Server-Sent Events (**SSE**) is specially tuned for real-time server-to-client communication.

Experience it live with our [demo streaming tweets](https://wave.qruto.dev) üê§.

## Support

In light of recent events in Ukraine, my life has taken an unexpected turn.
Since February 24th, I've lost my commercial work, my permanent residence,
and my ability to plan for the future.

During these challenging times, I derive strength and purpose from creating 
open source projects, such as Wave.
