# Introduction

Use Laravel [broadcasting system](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting) for sending events from server to client with üóº [**Server-sent Events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

ü§ù Supports [Laravel Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo).

## Support

I have spent a lot of time playing with SSE, Laravel broadcasting system and Redis to prepare **Laravel Wave** and make it available for everyone. Since of February 24, unfortunately I haven't any commercial work, permanent living place or the ability to plan anything for the long term. However, I have a greater desire to continue creating useful solutions for people around the world. It makes me feel better these days.

Now I'm trying to setup GitHub Sponsorships, but it currently not available for Ukrainian bank accounts. Searching for solutions through the 3rd party fiscal host. Looks like it requires some stars on the repository ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚≠ê

Would be very grateful for mentions or just a sincere "thank you" ü§ù
