# Introduction

Use Laravel [broadcasting system](https://laravel.com/docs/master/broadcasting) for sending events from server to client with üóº [**Server-sent Events**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

Supports [Laravel Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo).

[Demo with stream of tweets](https://wave.qruto.dev) üê§

## Support

I have spent a lot of effort playing with SSE, Laravel broadcasting system and Redis to prepare **Laravel Wave** and make it available for everyone. Since of February 24, unfortunately I haven't any commercial work, permanent living place or the ability to plan anything for the long term. However, I have a greater desire to continue creating useful solutions for people around the world. It makes me feel better these days.
